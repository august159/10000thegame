      <h2>Game history</h2>
      <p>
        In the past, this game was more particularly played by sailors and
        pirates. It was played with money and alcohol but the most popular rule
        among sailors was the kick in the buttocks. The principle of this rule
        allowed the winner to kick the butt of the losers. For example, 6
        players, the first one kicks 5 times and takes none, the second one
        kicks 4 times and takes 1, the third one kicks 3 times and takes 2, and
        so on. This rule allowed for a bit of entertainment during long
        crossings.

      <h2>Game principle</h2>
      <p>
        You roll the dice as long as you get points. With each roll that scores
        points, the player can decide to continue playing the remaining dice or
        to keep the score obtained. In this case, the score is added to the
        total score, and the next player rolls the dice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scores are noted in the form of "tiers". The score obtained on a roll of
        the dice is added to the previous score. The score obtained is the new
        level.
      </p>
      <h4>For example:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em
            >A player enters the game with a score of 1100. A score of 1100 is
            noted in his column.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <em
            >In the next round he gets 200 and decides to stop there. We note
            1300 below 1100.</em
          >
        </li>
        <li><em>And so on ...</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the player does not get any points on a throw, he loses the hand and
        gets a "tick". It is then up to the next player to roll the dice. The
        The check mark is represented by a bar next to the player's current
        landing. A At the third tick, the step is crossed out (striped) and the
        player returns to the previous level.
      </p>
      <p>The aim of the game is to make exactly 10000 points./p></p>

    <section class="rules">
      <h2>Scoring:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A 1 is worth 100 points, a 5 is worth 50 points.</li>
        <li>A triple ace (3 dice with 1) is worth 1000 points.</li>
        <li>
          This trick and the following ones (three of a kind, square, quintuple
          and straight) must be obtained in a single throw.
          <em
            >If you get a first 1 and then two more on the second throw, you get
            100 + 200 = 300 points and not 1000 points.</em
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          A three of a kind (3 identical dice) is worth 100 times the value of
          one of the 3 dice.
          <em
            >a three of a kind of 2 is worth 200 points, a three of a kind of 4
            is worth 400 points, a three of a kind of 5 is worth 500
            points).</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          A square (4 identical dice) is worth twice as much as a three of a
          kind <em>(a square of 6 is worth 1200)</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          One quintuple (5 identical dice) is worth double the square
          <em>(five 6 are therefore worth 2400)</em>.
        </li>
        <li>A quintuple of 1 is worth 4000</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Course of action:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A player start by rolling the 5 dice. If the dice score points - i.e.
          he gets at least a 5, a 1 or a figure - he can choose either to keep
          the points or to replay the dice that are not worth any points.
        </li>
        <li>
          A player can only enter the game (i.e. be out) and score points by
          getting 650 or more in a given round.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a player decides to keep his points, the next player can decide
          to start from scratch by playing the 5 dice or to start from the
          previous player's score if he is already out. The next player will
          only play the dice that are not worth any points. If he scores at
          least a die, then he adds up his points to the other player score
        </li>
        <li>
          In a full hand (all 5 dice are worth points) the player must replay
          all 5 dice. The score of the new hand is then added to that of the
          previous hand. A yam, a straight or a full house are considered full
          hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player to reach exactly 10,000 is declared the winner. If a
          player exceeds the 10000 with the score obtained, he takes a tick and
          it is up to the next player to throw.
        </li>
      </ol>
